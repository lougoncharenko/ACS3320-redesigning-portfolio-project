## Why you should know this or industry application (optional) (5 min)

Dates are important they appear in one form or another in almost every application you might create and they are a core part of programming. 

<!-- > -->

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Identify the components of a problem
1. Prioritize the steps to solutions
1. Writing pseudo code

<!-- > -->

## Date review

- What is a date?
- What is the Unix Epoch?
- What is UTC? 
- What is minimum unit of time in a JS Date?
- Which of these is correct? 
  - `new Date()`
  - `new Date(0)`
  - `new Date('9/26/65')`
  - `new Date(1983, 4, 31)`

## Date Library

## Getters and setters

Getters and Setters are class methods that act like properties. 

https://javascript.info/property-accessors

<!-- > -->

An accessor method is preceded with the keyword `get` or `set`.

<!-- > -->

```JS
class Example {
  get something() {
    return this._name
  }
  set something(name) {
    this._name = name
  }
}
```

A getter must return a value. Getters can not accept parameters!

<!-- > -->

Create a getter and setter for the `year`. 

```JS
get year() {
  return this._date.getFullYear()
}
```

Create a getter for `yr`. This should return the two-digit year. Use `%` to get this: 

```js
1983 % 100 = 83
```

<!-- > -->

```JS 
class D {
  ...

  // Getters can only return a value, they can not take parameters
  get year() {
    return this._date.getFullYear()
  }

  get yr() {
    return this.year % 100
  }
}

const date = new D() 
console.log( date.year ) // call the getter
console.log( date.yr )  // call the getter
```

<!-- > -->

Setters must accept a single parameter. A setter can not return anything:

<!-- > -->

```JS 
class D {
  ...
  // Setters must take only a single parameter, and can not return anything.
  set year(n) {
    // ...is n a number?
    this._date.setFullYear(n)
  }
}

const date = new D() 
date.year = 1975 // calls a function
console.log(date.year) // 1975
```

<!-- > -->

Now make a getter for `month` and `mon`. 

The first should return the full month for example: `January` the other should return the short month: `Jan`.

<!-- > -->

Since `Date.getMonth()` returns the index of the month you'll need an array of month strings long and short:

```JS
const months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
const monthsShort = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
const days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
const daysShort = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']
```

<!-- > -->

## Date format

<!-- > -->

Your date lib needs a good formatter. 

The mask is a string that describes components of the date and where they should fall in a string.

```
d.format('M d, Y') // August 31, 2022
```

<small>Here the mask string is 'M d, Y'. The format method replaces 'M' with the full month, 'd' with the day, and 'Y' with the year.</small>

<!-- > -->

How would you solve this problem? 

<!-- > -->

Identify the steps needed to come up with a solution?

<!-- > -->

1. You are building a method. Identify the input and output. 

```js
class D {
  ...
  format(str) {
    const outStr = '' // define the output
    // ...
    return outStr
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

2. Now what happens? 

<!-- > -->

Loop over each character in the mask string. With each iteration look at the current character or the mask string if it matches one of the special characters append the date component otherwise append the character. 

<!-- > -->

For example, imagine the mask string is: 'y/m/d'

```JS
const d = new D()
d.format('y/m/d') // 20/Nov/10
d.format('M d, Y') // January 10, 2021
```

1. 'y' -> replace with the short year '20'
2. '/' -> not special append it '20/'
3. 'm' -> replace with the short month '20/Nov'
4. '/' -> not special append it '20/Nov/'
5. 'd' -> replace with the date '20/Nov/10' 

<!-- > -->

3. Write psuedo code

<!-- > -->

3. Psuedo code: 

- Define a variable to hold the output string. This should start as an empty string.
- Loop over each character in your format string.
- If the character matches one of the formatting characters: `y, Y, m, M, d, D, ...` append the date element to the output string. If there's no match append that character to the output string. `if else` or `switch case` will work here. 
- Return the output string.

<!-- > -->

Reuse the other methods you already have to generate the date components. 

<!-- > -->

Define your method. Takes the mask string as a parameter. Define the output string. 

```JS
format(mask = '') {
  let dateStr = ''
  // ...
  return dateStr
}
```

<!-- > -->

Loop over each character in the format string: 

```JS
format(mask = '') {
  let dateStr = ''

  // loops for once for each character in mask
  for (let i = 0; i < mask.length; i += 1) {
    // Check and append to dateStr here...
  }

  return dateStr
 }
```

<!-- > -->

Check for special characters. One strategy is to use an object:

```JS
// Define an object
const special = {
  Y: this.year, // gets the full year from your class
  y: this.yr // gets the short year from your class
  ...
}

special['Y'] // 2021
special['y'] // 21
special['?'] // undefined
```

<!-- > -->

Use a conditional statement to get a date value or use the character: 

```JS
if (special[mask[i]] !== undefined) {
  dateStr += special[mask[i]]
} else {
  dateStr += mask[i]
}
```

<!-- > -->

## when() method 

<!-- > -->

The `when()` method will require you to look at a date and provide a human-readable string describing relative time between dates. 

It should return something like: 

'1 year ago' 

or 

'three weeks from now'. 

<!-- > -->

Think of your strategy.  

<!-- > -->

To do this you'll need to calculate the difference between two dates. You need the difference in years, months, and days. This way you can ask:

- Is the difference in months greater than 11? If so this date is years ago.
- Is the difference in days more than 30? If so the date is months ago.
- Is the difference in days more than 1 than the date is days ago.

<!-- > -->

Write some pseudo code.

<!-- > -->

How will you calculate the number of years, months, and days difference? 

<!-- > -->

Here are some thoughts on the process. 

<!-- > -->

Use your maths!

```JS
const bday = new Date('09/26/1965')
const today = new Date()
const diff = today - bday // should be the difference in ms
```

<!-- > -->

Use your methods!

```JS
const bday = new Date('09/26/1965')
const today = new Date()
// diff in years
const yearsDiff = today.getFullYear() - bday.getFullYear() 
// diff is months
const monthsDiff = today.getMonth() - bday.getMonth() 
```

The numbers here might be negative! 

<!-- > -->

Psuedo code: 

- Make a new date that is the current date
- Get the differnce between the two dates in...
  - years
  - months
  - days

<!-- > -->

- Check the differences: 
  - diff months > 11 the date was years ago
  - diff months < -11 is years from now
  - diff days > 30 the date was months from ago
  - diff days < -30 the date is months from now 
  - diff days > 0 the date was days ago
  - diff days < 0 the date is days from now

<!-- > -->

Here are a few things to think about: 

Consider: Dec 23, 2020, and Jan 1, 2021, are these dates 1 year apart? One month apart? Or just 9 days? It could be a year, but 9 days is also accurate. 

The correct answer may depend on your industry or business. You should decide which is correct and keep the answer in mind as you work. The potential output might be: 

- 1 year ago
- 1 month ago
- 9 days ago

<!-- > -->

Considering the output above, when the number of years, months, days, difference is 1 the output should read: 

- 1 year ago
- 1 month ago
- 1 day ago

<!-- > -->

When the difference is greater than 1 the output should read: 

- n years ago
- n months ago
- n days ago

<small>Note that the unit is plural!</small>

<!-- > -->

When you subtract the date in question from now if the answer is positive then that date is in the past. If the number is negative the date is in the future. 

<!-- > -->

Your output should read (past dates): 

- n year/s ago
- n month/s ago
- n day/s ago

Or (for future dates)

- n year/s from now
- n month/s from now
- n day/s from now

<!-- > -->

Create a date for now: 

```JS
class D {
  ...
  when() {
    // Create a new date
    const now = new Date()
    ...
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

You can use these same ideas to calculate the difference in months and days. 

Once you've got the difference you can start putting together the relative date string. 

<!-- > -->

The best tactic is to calculate the difference in months. From here you can check if the total months is more than 12 and reply with "years ago." If the total months is less than 12 you can reply with "months ago." 

<!-- > -->

Here is a rough idea of calculating the difference in months. 

```JS
const a = new Date(2019, 8, 26)
const b = new Date()
const dy = (b.getFullYear() - a.getFullYear())
const dm = b.getMonth() - a.getMonth()
const totalmonths = dy * 12 + dm

console.log(dy, dm) // 1 year, 2 months
console.log(totalmonths) // 14 months
```

<!-- > -->

Note! Here the possible values for months would be 0 (Jan) to 11 (Dec). That means the difference in months between Feb (1) 6 2021 and Dec (11) 23 2020 would be -10 (1 - 11) while the difference in years would be 1 (2021 - 2020).

<!-- > -->

To get a real count of the months adds 12 times the difference in years.

```JS
const totalmonths = dy * 12 + dm
```

<!-- > -->

You can calculate the total days between two dates like this: 

```JS
// 86400 = 60 * 60 * 24
const dd = (b - a) / 86400 / 1000
console.log(dd)
```

<!-- > -->

Get the difference between the dates and divide by one day or 86400 seconds then divide by milliseconds. 

Using this method you'll have the number of days difference. With this you can ask questions like: 

- Are days differences greater than 365.25?
- Are days difference greater than 30?
- Are days differences greater than 7?

<!-- > -->

Note! This method might miss a leap year since a year is technically 365.25 days in length. It also misses months with fewer or greater than 30 days which may or may not be noticed as a discrepancy by picky horologists. 

<!-- > -->

### Forming the output sentence

<!-- > -->

Here is an approach you might use. 

Use `Math.abs()` to get the absolute value. You'll need this since you won't want to print `-6 days ago`, `Math.abs(-6)` = 6. 

`Math.abs(daysDifference) < 7` would be true if `daysDifference` were -6 or +6.

<!-- > -->

You can use ternary operator to decide when to add an 's'. For example: 

```js
const dd = -4
// if the absolute value of `dd` is greater than 1 we add an s after day
console.log(`${Math.abs(dd)} day${Math.abs(dd) > 1 ? 's' : ''}`)
```

<!-- > -->

Here is more of a solution: 

```JS
// Check if absolute number of days is less than 7 
if (Math.abs(dd) < 7) {
  // `${number} day${s?} ${ago or from now}`
  // 6 days ago
  return `${Math.abs(dd)} day${Math.abs(dd) > 1 ? 's' : ''} ${dd < 0 ? 'ago' : 'from now'}` )
} else if (Math.abs(dw) < 4) {
  return `${Math.abs(dw)} week${Math.abs(dw) > 1 ? 's' : ''} ${dw < 0 ? 'ago' : 'from now'}`)
} else if (...) {
  ...
} 
```
