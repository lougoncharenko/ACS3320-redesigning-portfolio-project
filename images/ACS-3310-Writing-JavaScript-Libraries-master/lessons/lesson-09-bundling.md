# ACS 3310 - Bundling Libraries

<small style="display:block;text-align:center">Bundling Libraries for distribution</small>

<!-- > -->

This class session covers the concept of bundling. This is the process of combining files and processing them for use and distribution. 

Why do we need to bundle code? To understand this you need to understand the problem that bundling solves. Before 2015 JS didn't have the concept of a module built in. Read this article: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/

From the article we get the following concepts: 

- JS variables are global which is a problem
- All code is global which is a problem
- Modules compartmentalize code to solve these problems
- esmodules were introduced in 2015

Info on esmodules: https://javascript.info/import-export

Newer browsers can use esmodules, but there are still many older browsers out in the world that don't support this. For these we might want to bundle code using the commonJS system. NodeJS has recently added support for esmodules but much of the existing code still uses the commonjs (require) system.

## Why learn how to bundle files? 

<!-- > -->

🎁

Bundling is used in professional environments. Bundling code yourself will help you understand how modern web projects work. 

🧐

<!-- > -->

🎁 ➡️ 🌍

Bundling your files allows them to be distributed so they can be used anywhere without extra work. 

<!-- > -->

Your files need to be handled differently if they are used in the browser, NodeJS, or in a React project. 

Bundling files allows them to be used in all these. 

🍎 🍊 🍐

## Learning Objectives 

1. Describe reasons for bundling files
1. Describe modules 
1. Use Webpack to bundle code

<!-- > -->

## Bundling with Webpack

<!-- > -->

References:

- https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/
- https://tobias-barth.net/blog/Bundling-your-library-with-Webpack

<!-- > -->

Follow these steps to bundle your code with webpack. 

<!-- > -->

Choose one of your library projects to work with. 

<!-- > -->

Install webpack:

```
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

From here you are ready to bundle code.

Create `webpack.config.js`. This file tells webpack how to bundle. You can use webpack without a config file and will will create `./dist/bundle.js` using it's default settings. 

Add the following to `webpack.config.js`: 

```JS
// umd 
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
		library: 'lib',
		libraryTarget: 'umd',
		globalObject: 'this',
  },
};
```

Here you have configured webpack by: 
- setting the entry point. This tells webpack which file contains the code it should bundle. 
- Set the output path and folder name `dist`, and file name `bundle.js`
- You also set the name of the lib. This creates a global variable for non-esmodule platforms. 
- You set the to type of module to umd, which is compatible with NodeJS. 

If you are using TypeScript you can follow the instructions below to add TypeScript to your bundling pipeline. 

<!-- > -->

Install TypeScript and TypeScript Loader:

```
npm install typescript ts-loader --save-dev
```

<!-- > -->

Make a new file: `tsconfig.json`

Add the following:

```JSON
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "module": "es6",
    "target": "es5",
    "jsx": "react",
    "allowJs": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

Create a new file: `webpack.config.js`

Add the following: 

```JS
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
  },
  output: {
    filename: 'index.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
		library: 'lib',
		libraryTarget: 'umd',
		globalObject: 'this',
  },
};
```

<!-- > -->

You may need to edit the values here: 

- `entry`: points to your source file
- `filename`: names the output file
- `path`: sets the output directory
- `library`: sets the name of the global variable created in a browser environment

<!-- > -->

Edit package.json

Add this to scripts: 

```JSON
"build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
```

<!-- > -->

Bundle your files by running: 

```
npm run build
```

<!-- > -->

In these steps you added webpack to your project and added a script to run webpack and have it bundle your code. 

👠 👑 🎧 ➡️ 🎁

<!-- > -->

## What is a bundle and why do we have them? 

🤔

<!-- > -->

In the old days you could write code and run it in a browser. 

That was it. 

<!-- > -->

Until recently, code run in browser was global. Any variables that were created were accessible from anywhere. 

<!-- > -->

What could go wrong? 

<!-- > -->

Imagine importing a couple libraries only to find out that they don't work because the code on one is redefining a variable used in the other. 

<!-- > -->

script-1.js
```JS
function counter() {
  // does something really important
}
```

script-2.js
```JS
var counter = 0
```

Run your code
```JS
counter() // calls function
TypeError: counter is not a function.
```

<!-- > -->

This is was really happening. 

So clever people invented a module system. 

<!-- > -->

The two popular module systems were:

- [CommonJS](https://www.commonjs.org)
- [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org)

<!-- > -->

CommonJS is JavaScript code that wraps your JS code. It allows you to create modules. 

<!-- > -->

If you've ever used: 

```JS
const duckPond = require('pond')
```

You've been using RequireJS!

<!-- > -->

What's a module?

A module is a block of code that contains all of it's variables. Usually a module is a file. 

- [What's a module](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/167859/what-actually-is-a-module-in-software-engineering)
- [Where JS modules come from](https://medium.com/sungthecoder/javascript-module-module-loader-module-bundler-es6-module-confused-yet-6343510e7bde)
- [History of JS modules](https://objectpartners.com/2019/05/24/javascript-modules-a-brief-history/)

<!-- > -->

Modules in a nutshell.

- A file defines a module. 
- All variables and functions are scoped to that file. 
- A module may export values it wants to share.

<!-- > -->

Hey, don't we have these already...

<!-- > -->

ES Modules was added to the JavaScript spec in 2015, and by 2020 had broad support in most web browsers and JavaScript runtimes.

<!-- > -->

Wow! That was like last week! 

Are ES modules that new? 

Yes, they are! 

<!-- > -->

ES Modules are where we get `import from`: 

```JS
import Amazing, { things } from 'some-lib'
...
export default SomethingUseful
```

<!-- > -->

script-1.js
```JS
let counter = 0
...
```

script-2.js
```JS
function counter() {
  return ...something really important...
}

export default counter
```

In script-1 counter is not exposed. Script-2 exports counter, it can be imported where it is needed. 

Using modules these identifiers do not clash!

<!-- > -->

They probably don't work in older browsers!

What are going to do? 😱

<!-- > -->

Bundle our code! (using CommonJS and RequireJS) 

<!-- > -->

Bundling also makes our code compatible with different environments. 

<!-- > -->

What types of environments are there? 

- Browser
- NodeJS
- ...

<!-- > -->

Ever notice that the browser doesn't support `require()` but NodeJS uses it a lot!  

Require is another code wrapper that works with CommonJS. You can use it in the browser if you import it. 

- https://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html

<!-- > -->

Let's review:

- In JS land everything is global (variables and stuff)
- CommonJS was invented to create a module system
  - Modules allow variables with the same name to live in their own module
- RequireJS was invented to allow things to be shared between modules

<!-- > -->

Universal Module Definition UMD is a format combines CommonJS and RequireJS. It takes into account whether your code is running in a browser or in a node environment. 

<!-- > -->

Wait, where did UMD come from? 

Remember the webpack.config?

```JS
output: {
  filename: 'index.js',
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  library: 'reallyRandom',
  libraryTarget: 'umd', <--
  globalObject: 'this',
},
```

<!-- > -->

What does UMD do for me? 

Allows your libraries run in the browser or in Node.

<!-- > -->

Why is that important? 

<!-- > -->

If you are going to write code that runs in the browser you should understand all of the tooling that makes it work. 

<!-- > -->

If you are going to use modern libraries like React, they all use these ideas, you should understand what is happening behind the scenes. 

<!-- > -->

How can I prove that all of this is doing what was described here? 

<!-- > -->

Make two files: 

1. `example-node.js`
2. `example-browser.html`

Imagine these are two separate projects. One is a browser project the other is a NodeJS project. 

<!-- > -->

After building your code following steps above take note of the file name and location of your bundled code. This file named in ouput section of the webpack config. 

<!-- > -->

In `example-node.js` import your code by adding: 

```JS
const lib = require('./path/to/bundle.js')
// add some code here to test your lib
```

Run this in your terminal.

<!-- > -->
 
In `example-browser.html` add a script tag:

```HTML
<script src="./path/to/bundle.js"></script>
<script>
  // Add some code here to test your lib
</script>
```

In this example the code will added the variable with the name used in: `library: 'lib'` the name here is lib. You can change it but will need to run webpack and bundle again!  

<!-- > -->

We just did something with code that makes it run in the browser and Node? 

<!-- > -->

Your code would not run in both places without this!

<!-- > -->

It's why you can use jQuery, Underscore, and many other libraries!

<!-- > -->

Let's Review: 

- Once upon time there was JavaScript
- JS had some problems with global variables
- Wizards fixed this with some magic spells they called CommonJS and RequireJS
- JS was improved but not everyone can use those improvements.
- So we make our JS work everywhere with UMD

<!-- > -->

## How to make a umd module with webpack

Use webpack like this: 

```JS
// umd 
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
		library: 'lib',
		libraryTarget: 'umd',
		globalObject: 'this',
  },
};
```

This creates a module that will work in the borwser with all code attached to the variable: `lib`. This module will also work with NodeJS and `require()`.

## How to make an es module with webpack

The following will create a module that will work with the `import from` syntax. 

```JS
// esm
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
	experiments: {
    outputModule: true,
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
		library: {
			type: "module"
		},
  },
};
```

This module will be output as index.js. 

## How to create both an esm and umd module

Webpack will create multiple module modules if you supply an array of configurations. 

```JS
// esm+umd
module.exports = [{
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
		library: 'lib',
		libraryTarget: 'umd',
		globalObject: 'this',
  }
},
	{
  entry: './src/index.js',
	experiments: {
    outputModule: true,
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'index.js',
		library: {
			type: "module"
		},
  },
}
];
```

This will output a umd module as `dist/bundle.js` and an esm module as `dist/index.js`.
