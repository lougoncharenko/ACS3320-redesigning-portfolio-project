# ACS 3310 Custom project 

The goal of this project is to write your own library. 

Here are a few ideas for code libraries that you might 
write. 

- Libraries that are just code 
	- Deck of cards - Library that manages a deck of cards. This would have methods that draw cards, shuffles the deck. 
- Libraries that work with APIs 
	- Choose an API that you like and build an API that simplifies working with that API. 
		- You can choose a Browser API like: fetch, geolocation, or canvas. 
		- You can choose a web API like: swapi, openweathermap etc. 
- Create a React Component 
	- Think of a React Component that would be useful in a wide range of projects. This could any type of common UI elements like Counters, Menus, Sliders.
