# ACS 3310 Final Assessment

Test your skills gained this term by solving this problem. 

### Challenge 1

You are tasked with writing a phone number formatter. It should take in a 10 digit number or string of numbers and return a string formatted as a phone number. 

Format the phone number as: (xxx) xxx-xxxx. You'll need to 
write a function to do the formatting. It should take a 10
digit number/string: 4155448375, and return a string formatted as:

> (415) 544-8375

Write a function to handle this number formatting function. It should take a number/string as a parameter and return the formatted phone number as a string.

Write your solution in TypeScript. Be sure to use the linter to spot any errors and provide codying best practice suggestions. 

Compile your TypeScript solution. 

Stretch goal: This function could take in a partially formatted phone number and still produce a fully formatted phone number string on ouput. For example: 

- 209 766 1611
- 555 456-9809
- 688-777-8376

You neeed to remove any extra characters and spaces and format as described above. 

## Challenge 2

Write unit tests for your phone number formatter. Look for edge cases and write unit tests to identify these. 

## Challenge 3

Publish your work to npm.

Stretch challenge: Bundle your code as a UMD library. 

## Challenge 4 

Create a test app that uses your library from npm. This should install your library from npm and display a formatted phone number. You can use Node js. 

Stretch challenge: Create a test app for NodeJS and another runs in the browser.
